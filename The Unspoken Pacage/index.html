            <p>
                This is a VR game that can be experienced by multiple people, and the audience will become a virtual person from a first person perspective. In VR space, virtual people rotate around the center, with those closer to the center getting larger and those farther away getting smaller. Each virtual person has their own "communication circle", and when they approach a certain level, the audience can hear their voices. At the center of the space is a huge virtual human, constantly speaking to the nearest virtual human. Its voice can be heard throughout the entire space, but its words are some inexplicable sounds. As the audience gradually approaches the virtual person in the center, their body also gradually enlarges. At this point, the virtual person in the center will turn around and face the audience, speaking to them. As the audience turns around and leaves, their bodies gradually shrink again.
                 By mixing art and technology, we hope to invite players to think about who gets to speak and who stays silent in today's connected world.
