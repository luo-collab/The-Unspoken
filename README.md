# The-Unspoken
Contest Entry
Wonderland volcano:
This is a VR game that can be experienced by multiple people, and
the audience will become a virtual person from a first person perspective. In VR space, virtual people rotate around the center, with
those closer to the center getting larger and those farther away
getting smaller. Each virtual person has their own "communication
circle", and when they approach a certain level, the audience can
hear their voices. At the center of the space is a huge virtual human,
constantly speaking to the nearest virtual human. Its voice can be
heard throughout the entire space, but its words are some inexplicable sounds. As the audience gradually approaches the virtual
person in the center, their body also gradually enlarges. At this
point, the virtual person in the center will turn around and face
the audience, speaking to them. As the audience turns around and
leaves, their bodies gradually shrink again.
We have designed a space based VR experience that, after setting the center of the space, calculates the distance between the virtual body and the center, changes the size of the audience's virtual body in real time, and adjusts the field of view of the camera to change the size of the audience's field of view. The further away from the center, the smaller the audience's body and the narrower their field of view. What's more, we also used sound design to further express the tension of the work.

The hardware device we use is a VR headset. Viewers can scan the
QR code on their mobile phones to download the app, and then connect to the headset on their phones to easily experience our project.
The movement of virtual humans is controlled by controllers, and
after establishing an interactive link between Android phones and
controllers, the controller can be used to control the movement of
virtual humans. The software development mainly uses Unity3D, and the construction of VR environment and the implementation of interactive
functions are basically completed in Unity.

Ultimately, we hope that this project can draw the audience’s
attention to ’The Unspoken’ in their daily lives.We hope to invite
players to think about who gets to speak and who stays silent in
today’s connected world.
